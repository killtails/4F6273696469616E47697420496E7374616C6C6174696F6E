# What is Obsidian?
Obsidian.md is a popular note-taking and knowledge management application. It is designed to help users organize and connect their thoughts, ideas, and notes in a flexible and interconnected manner. Obsidian is often referred to as a "second brain" tool due to its focus on building a knowledge graph of interconnected notes.

Key features of Obsidian.md include:

1. **Markdown Support:** Obsidian uses Markdown, a lightweight markup language, for note formatting. This makes it easy to create well-structured and readable notes with plain text.

2. **Bi-directional Linking:** One of the standout features of Obsidian is its support for bi-directional linking. This means that if you create a link from one note to another, Obsidian automatically creates a backlink from the second note to the first. This helps in creating a web of interconnected thoughts.

3. **Graph View:** Obsidian provides a graph view that visually represents the relationships between your notes. This can be useful for understanding the connections and patterns in your knowledge base.

4. **Local Storage:** Obsidian stores your notes as plain text files on your local machine. This gives users control over their data and allows them to use their preferred cloud storage or version control systems.

5. **Customizable:** Users can customize the Obsidian experience by creating custom themes, plugins, and using various settings to tailor the application to their preferences.

6. **Tags and Categories:** You can organize your notes using tags and categories, making it easier to find and navigate through your knowledge base.

Obsidian.md is widely used by students, researchers, writers, and knowledge workers for personal and professional note-taking and knowledge management. It has gained popularity for its focus on simplicity, flexibility, and the ability to foster creative thinking by encouraging non-linear connections between ideas.

## Vaults
In Obsidian, a "vault" refers to the directory or folder where your notes are stored. It contains all the Markdown files that make up your collection of notes. When you create or open a vault in Obsidian, you are essentially working within that specific directory, and Obsidian treats all the Markdown files within that directory as part of your knowledge base.

To create a new vault or open an existing one in Obsidian, you typically choose a directory on your computer where you want to store your notes. Once a vault is created or opened, you can start creating and organizing your notes within that specific directory. 

- After installing Obsidian, you are given the option to
	- **Create new vault**

	- **Open vault from Obsidian Sync**
